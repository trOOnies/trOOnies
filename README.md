Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page.
*(Last updated: September 2025.)*

## Introduction

I'm a Data Scientist from Argentina [he/him]. I'm in my late 20s. I am actually an [Industrial Engineer](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/undergraduate-courses/industrial-engineering/) with a greater orientation on Business than a typical IE degree. I graduated from Buenos Aires' [ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/) (5-year-long degree, equivalent to a BEng & MEng).

I specialize in LLM-based information extraction from documents.

I like to learn a wide range of topics on ML and LLMs, but I sometimes like to learn other things like front-end or -actual- languages.

If you are interested in connecting via LinkedIn, send me a PM!
