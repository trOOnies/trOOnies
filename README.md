*(Last updated: March 2024.)*

Hello there! I'm Facundo, welcome to my GitHub page.
- 🌎 I'm a Data Scientist from Argentina [he/him]. I'm in my late 20s.
- 👨‍🎓 I am actually an [Industrial Engineer](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/undergraduate-courses/industrial-engineering/) with a greater orientation on Business than a typical IE degree. I graduated from Buenos Aires' [ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/) (5-year-long degree, equivalent to a BEng & MEng).
- 🐍 I code in Python. I regularly use Google Cloud Platform, mainly the services that Vertex AI provides, and BigQuery. I also worked with AWS SageMaker. I usually use libraries such as FastAPI, sklearn, PyTesseract, optuna and spaCy.
- 🔨 Other tools I used: Docker, MLflow, Dagster, Airbyte+dbt
- 💼 Work experience (more recent first)
  - DataArt (current): AI & ML Engineer for DataArt's clients.
  - La Nacion Media Group: 1 year in a DS team. I developed and deployed different ML models for the MG website, and built the code and service base we used for MLOps from the ground up on GCP. I regularly took a proactive approach on the future projects' pipeline and hiring interviews.
  - Santander (Bank) Technology: 2.5 years in ML areas, with focus on Information Extraction from Documents. Used AWS, Cloudera, GitLab and OCP.
  - Accenture: 2 years in the Business Data Science area, where I participated on different projects every 3 to 5 months.
- 📚 I like to learn a wide range of topics on ML, but I sometimes like to learn other things like front-end or -actual- languages.
- 🎌 I am a native Spanish speaker, but I also speak other languages:
  - (Certified) British English CEFR C1 - C.A.E.
  - (Certified) Mandarin Chinese - HSK3 (version 2.0)
  - (Finished) Italian CEFR B1-equivalent course
