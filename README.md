Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page.
*(Last updated: August 2025.)*

## Background

- 🌎 I'm a Data Scientist from Argentina [he/him]. I'm in my late 20s.
- 👨‍🎓 I am actually an [Industrial Engineer](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/undergraduate-courses/industrial-engineering/) with a greater orientation on Business than a typical IE degree. I graduated from Buenos Aires' [ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/) (5-year-long degree, equivalent to a BEng & MEng).
- 🐍 I code in Python. I used Google Cloud Platform for MLE, and I also worked with AWS SageMaker. At the moment I'm maining Azure OpenAI API with the Python SDK.
- 🔨 Other tools I used: FastAPI, Langchain, Gradio, Docker, MLflow, Dagster, Airbyte + dbt, Jenkins, Airflow.
- 💼 Work experience _(more recent first)_
  - **IT Patagonia**: Data Scientist for IT Patagonia's client, **Bank of Galicia** (Argentina).
  - **DataArt**: AI & ML Engineer for DataArt's clients. Used GCP.
  - **La Nacion Media Group**: I developed and deployed different ML models for the MG's website, and built the code and service base we used for MLOps from the ground up on GCP. I regularly took a proactive approach on the future projects' pipeline and hiring interviews.
  - **Santander (Bank) Technology**: Information extraction from document files. Used AWS, GitLab and OCP.
  - **Accenture**: Business Data Scientist. I participated on a different project every 3 to 5 months.
- 📚 I like to learn a wide range of topics on ML and LLMs, but I sometimes like to learn other things like front-end or -actual- languages.
- 🎌 I speak many languages:
  - 🇪🇦 Native Spanish
  - 🇬🇧 C1 British English (Certified)
  - 🇮🇹 B2 Italian (Dante Alighieri Association's Course)
  - 🇨🇳 A1 Mandarin Chinese (Certified)

## Projects

Personal projects:

  - Take into account that I'm using many repos for the same conceptual project, and I'm constantly cleaning and moving stuff around.

Course projects:
- 2024 [Mentre PDA](https://github.com/trOOnies/itba-pda-scasso): Project for ITBA's Python Data Applications (PDA). Based on a fictional 'Mentre' company and the multiple DE developments needed for the application to work.
- 2023 [Recommender System](https://github.com/trOOnies/recommender_system): Project for ITBA's MLOps course, targeted at Data Scientists that already have DS experience but less in MLOps.
