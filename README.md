*(Last updated: September 2024.)*

Hello there! I'm Facundo, welcome to my GitHub page.
- 🌎 I'm a Data Scientist from Argentina [he/him]. I'm in my late 20s.
- 👨‍🎓 I am actually an [Industrial Engineer](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/undergraduate-courses/industrial-engineering/) with a greater orientation on Business than a typical IE degree. I graduated from Buenos Aires' [ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/en/) (5-year-long degree, equivalent to a BEng & MEng).
- 🐍 I code in Python. I regularly use Google Cloud Platform for MLE, and I also worked with AWS SageMaker. At the moment I'm maining FastAPI, LangChain and Gradio.
- 🔨 Other tools I used: Docker, MLflow, Dagster, Airbyte+dbt, Jenkins.
- 💼 Work experience (more recent first)
  - DataArt: AI & ML Engineer for DataArt's clients.
  - La Nacion Media Group: 1 year in a DS team. I developed and deployed different ML models for the MG's website, and built the code and service base we used for MLOps from the ground up on GCP. I regularly took a proactive approach on the future projects' pipeline and hiring interviews.
  - Santander (Bank) Technology: 2.5 years in ML areas, with focus on information extraction from documents. Used AWS, GitLab and OCP.
  - Accenture: 2 years in the Business Data Science area, where I participated on a different project every 3 to 5 months.
- 📚 I like to learn a wide range of topics on ML, but I sometimes like to learn other things like front-end or -actual- languages.
- 🎌 I am a native Spanish speaker, but I also speak other languages:
  - (Certified) British English CEFR C1
  - (Finished) Italian CEFR B1-equivalent course
  - (Certified) Mandarin Chinese CEFR A1

  - Take into account that I'm using many repos for the same conceptual project, and I'm constantly cleaning and moving stuff around.

Course projects on GitHub:
- 2023 [Recommender System](https://github.com/trOOnies/recommender_system): Project for ITBA's MLOps course, targeted at Data Scientists that already have DS experience but less in MLOps.
