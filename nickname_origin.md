I've been recently asked about the origin of my nickname.

'trOOnies' comes from a game I really enjoyed when I was little. It's called 'Troonies: Castle Rock', and its playstyle resembles the more widely-known game [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)).

The letters 'O' are capitalized because then the nickname looks like it has a pair of open eyes.
